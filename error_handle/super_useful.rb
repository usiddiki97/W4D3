# Phase 4: Ensure BestFriend is a real best friend

# Overview

# Another use case for raising errors is to enforce correct usage of code. For example,
# if a function requires its arguments to be of certain types in order to execute properly,
# it might be best to check their type before executing any logic. This is useful because
# it allows us to inform the user that they are not using our function properly, rather
# than a runtime error being raised which may seem like a bug in our code or be more difficult to debug.

# Instructions

# If we look at user_script.rb, we see that our dear user thinks you can be besties if
# you've known each other less than a year. We do not agree. Friendships, like a fine wine,
# need at least five years to mature. Update BestFriend#initialize, in super_useful.rb,
# to raise a descriptive error when yrs_known is less than 5.

# Test your code, then assume the role of our dear user and update our call to
# BestFriend#new to create a real friendship (yrs_known>= 5).

# Our dear user also thinks it's okay to leave name and fav_pastime empty when
# creating a new instance of BestFriend. But it's not okay. It leaves #do_friendstuff
# and #give_friendship_bracelet sorely lacking. Poorly formatted text just makes
# us seethe with displeasure. Update the initialize method to raise descriptive
# errors when given strings of length <= 0.

# Test your code, then again assume the role of our dear user and update our call
# to BestFriend#new.

# Recap

# Raising errors for invalid arguments can ensure that our code is used the way
# we want intend. However, be aware that the types of inputs we can receive are
# numerous. We don't want or need to be checking against every possible type for
# each argument we receive.
